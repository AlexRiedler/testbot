0.5.3

Added support for rubygems-test and http://gem-testers.org.

0.5.1

Fixed a bug that caused exit status to be 1 even if the test run is successful.

Made the status page load faster but check less often.

0.4.9

There is now a very basic status page at http://testbot_server:2288/status.

0.4.8

Removed all remaining native dependencies to make testbot simpler to install.

0.4.7

- Refactored the code into modules with one directory for each.
- No longer dependent on mongel, now using webrat.

Fixed a bug that caused auto_update not to check for an update after a job had been run.

0.4.5

Made auto_update a bit more reliable.

0.4.4

Changed to using the deamons gem. Seems to fix some problems with old processes
not closing down when using auto_update.

Added support for quick deploys when developing testbot.

0.4.0

Fixed RSpec 2 compability issue.

0.3.9

0.3.6

Added Rails 2 generator support.

0.3.5

Fixed ssh_tunnel bug when using a custom user.

0.3.4

Bundler support. Testbot now runs "bundle" before "testbot:before_run" if you
have "bundle" in path and have a "Gemfile" in the project so that the
rails environment can load.

0.1.9

The server can now handle if a runner is shutdown in the middle of a test run (it will give the
job to another runner).

0.1.8

Added cucumber support and failure detection to the client. Added docs. Added code that uses
historic test runtimes to reduce test runtime (in theory).

0.1.7

Added a basic client so that testbot can be installed as a rails plugin. 'rake testbot:spec'.

Now only fetching the code once, and only keeping one copy of it. Less overhead.
