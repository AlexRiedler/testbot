0.3.3

Fixed loading issue in rails 2, testbot depended on having rails installed as a gem.

0.3.0

Made testbot into a gem. Simplified the design. Added a CLI. Removed git support.

0.2.3

Added JRuby support.

0.2.2

Replaced runtime optimization code with a simpler file size based method.

0.2.1

Added support for Test:Unit and multiple projects.

0.2.0

Added "ssh_tunnel" so that you don't have to be able to access the http server directly.

0.1.9

The server can now handle if a runner is shutdown in the middle of a test run (it will give the
job to another runner).

0.1.8

Added cucumber support and failure detection to the client. Added docs. Added code that uses
historic test runtimes to reduce test runtime (in theory).

0.1.7

Added a basic client so that testbot can be installed as a rails plugin. 'rake testbot:spec'.

Now only fetching the code once, and only keeping one copy of it. Less overhead.

Added "/runners/total_instances" to be able to balance requesters by knowing how many instances
there are in total.

Added "/runners/available" to see how many runners are available.
